        <h2>The Three Pillars of Blockchain: Decentralization, Immutability, and Transparency</h2>
        <p>
            Blockchain technology is built on three fundamental pillars that make it so revolutionary. Understanding these is key to understanding blockchain itself.
        </p>

        <h3>1. <i>Decentralization</i></h3>
        <p>
            Instead of information being held in one central place, it's spread across a huge network of computers. This means no single person or entity has control. <u>This is the most critical pillar</u>.
        </p>

        <h4>2. <b>Immutability</b></h4>
        <p>
            This means something is unchanging over time. Once a transaction is recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted. This is not like a normal file<sub>1</sub> you can just edit.
        </p>
        <pre>
        Centralized:  A -> B <- C
        Decentralized: A <-> B <-> C <-> A
        </pre>

        <h5>3. Transparency</h5>
        <p>
            For public blockchains, all transactions are visible to anyone who has access to the network. This creates a level of trust and accountability. It's not a secret system. <s>Only admins can see it</s>. <del>It's hidden from users</del>. It's <mark>open for public verification</mark>.
        </p>
