        <h2>What Is Blockchain? A Simple Explanation for Beginners</h2>
        <p>
            At its core, a blockchain is a special type of database. Think of it as a <b>digital ledger</b> of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across an entire network of computer systems. <i>This isn't your typical spreadsheet!</i>
        </p>

        <h3>Key Features</h3>
        <p>Here are some of the core ideas, which we'll explore more later:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It's decentralized.</li>
            <li>The data is immutable (can't be changed).</li>
            <li>It's transparent.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>How a Block Works</h4>
        <p>Each "block" in the chain contains a number of transactions. Every time a new transaction occurs, a record of it is added to every participant's ledger. It's like a shared notebook. <u>Everyone has a copy</u>.</p>
        <pre>
        +---------------------------+
        | Block N                   |
        |---------------------------|
        | Transaction 1             |
        | Transaction 2             |
        | Transaction 3             |
        +---------------------------+
        </pre>

        <h5>Misconceptions</h5>
        <p>
            Here are some outdated ideas: <s>Blockchain is only for Bitcoin</s>. That's not true! Another wrong idea is that <del>it's a private company database</del>. The key is that it's public. We should <mark>always remember it's a distributed system</mark>.
        </p>

        <h6>A Quick Comparison</h6>
        <p>Let's compare it to a simple list. An old grocery list might be: Milk, Eggs, Bread<sub>1</sub>.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Bread</li>
        </ol>
        <p><span>This is just a simple list</span>, whereas a blockchain is a complex, linked structure. For more, check out this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain" target="_blank">Wikipedia article</a>.</p>
