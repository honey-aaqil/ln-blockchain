                <td>Blockchain is a revolutionary technology that's changing how we store and share information online. At its core, it's like a <b>digital ledger</b>—a record-keeping system that's <i>secure</i>, transparent, and hard to tamper with. <u>Imagine a shared notebook</u> where everyone can write entries, but once something is written, it can't be erased or changed without everyone noticing. That's blockchain in a nutshell.</td>

                <td>
                    The name comes from how the technology is structured:
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Blocks</b>: These are like individual pages in the notebook. Each block contains a list of records, often called transactions (such as sending money or sharing data).</li>
                        <li><b>Chain</b>: The blocks are linked together in a sequence using special codes called hashes. Each block points to the one before it, creating a chain that's nearly impossible to break.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <span>This setup ensures that the entire history of records is preserved and connected.</span>

                    Blockchain isn't just a fancy database; it has unique traits that set it apart. Some think it's <s>just a trend</s>, but it's a <mark>foundational shift</mark>.
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Decentralized</b>: Unlike traditional systems controlled by a single company or bank, blockchain runs on a network of computers (called nodes) spread around the world. No one person or group has full control.</li>
                        <li><b>Secure</b>: It uses cryptography—complex math—to lock the information. This makes it very hard for hackers to alter data.</li>
                        <li><b>Immutable</b>: Once data is added, it's permanent. <del>You can easily delete records.</del> Changing it would require rewriting the entire chain, which is practically impossible on a large network.</li>
                    </ul>

                    Think of blockchain like a group project where everyone has a copy of the same document. If someone tries to sneak in a change to their copy, the group can compare versions and spot the difference right away. This is how blockchain builds trust without needing a central authority<sub>[1]</sub>.
