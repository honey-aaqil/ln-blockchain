        <h2>How Does a Blockchain Transaction Actually Work?</h2>
        <p>
            A transaction on a blockchain is a process with several steps. It's not just a simple "send" button; it's a secure and verifiable process. Let's walk through it. <i>It's quite fascinating!</i>
        </p>

        <h3>The Lifecycle of a Transaction</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Initiation</b>: A user initiates a transaction using their digital wallet.</li>
            <li><b>Broadcast</b>: The transaction is broadcast to the peer-to-peer (P2P) network.</li>
            <li><b>Validation</b>: Nodes on the network validate the transaction and the user's status.</li>
            <li><b>Block Creation</b>: The validated transaction is bundled with others into a new block.</li>
            <li><b>Confirmation</b>: The new block is added to the blockchain, and the transaction is complete.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>A Closer Look at Validation</h4>
        <p>Validation is a critical step. <u>Each node in the network checks the transaction's validity</u>. This prevents fraud. This is not done by a central authority. <s>A bank approves it</s>. <del>An admin checks it</del>. It's the network itself that provides the trust.</p>
        <pre>
        Transaction {
          from: "UserA",
          to: "UserB",
          amount: 1.23,
          signature: "..."
        }
        </pre>

        <h5>Transaction is Final</h5>
        <p>Once a transaction is in a block, it is <mark>permanent and cannot be altered</mark>. This is the immutability we talked about. This is a core feature, not a bug<sub>[1]</sub>.</p>
